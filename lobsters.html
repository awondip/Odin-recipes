        <ol>
            <li><p>First place a large pot of salted water over high heat.</p> </li>
            <li><p>Once the water comes to a boil, place whole, live lobsters head down in the water. </p> </li>
            <li><p>Cook the lobsters according to the times listed below, which are based on the weight of the lobsters. </p> </li>
            <li><p>After the lobsters have turned bright red and are cooked through, remove them from the boiling water. </p> </li>
            <li><p>Let the lobsters cool slightly, then serve as-is or with a side of melted butter.  </p> </li>
            <li>
              <p>Place your live lobsters in the freezer for about 20 minutes before you plan to cook them. This puts the lobsters to sleep, which makes them a lot easier to handle. </p>

            <li><p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon of salt per gallon of water. </p> </li>
            <li><p>Remove the lobsters from the boiling water. Let them cool for 5 minutes, then serve with melted butter on the side. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs as desired. </p> </li>
